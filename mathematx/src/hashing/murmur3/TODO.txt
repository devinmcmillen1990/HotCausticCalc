âœ… Recommendations:
1. Refactor process_chunks() to Apply Loop Unrolling:
    This will reduce branching overhead and increase throughput.

2. Implement Memory Prefetching:
    Ensure that data is prefetched into the cache, especially for the 64-byte processing loop.

3. Parallel Processing for Large Datasets:
    Implement a multi-threaded version of the Murmur3 hashing function for large datasets to leverage multiple CPU cores.
